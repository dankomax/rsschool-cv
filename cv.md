## About myself:

Being a curious individual, I like to learn new skills. I'm a strong believer in a lifelong learning and self-education.
Roughly two years ago, I became interested in programming. Since then, It's been my passion. I've covered quite a few programming languages and technologies, developed some training projects. And now, I would like to become a part of a real-world project as a developer.
I always focus on performing to the best of my ability. And I hope to be of service to any team, that might be interested in my skills and knowledge.
